# 🌍 Travel Recommendation System using RAG

This project is a **Travel Guide Assistant** developed as part of Intel Industrial Training – Scaledown Challenge 2.  
It uses the concept of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide personalized travel recommendations based on user input such as destination and budget.

The system generates:
- Personalized itineraries
- Hotel suggestions
- Places to visit
- Food recommendations
- Local travel tips

## 🎯 Project Objective

To build a simple and intelligent travel recommendation system that:
- Uses RAG architecture
- Handles large destination guides efficiently (Scaledown concept)
- Provides personalized itineraries
- Supports budget-based planning
- Offers an easy-to-use web interface

---

## ✨ Features

- Personalized travel itinerary generation  
- Hotel and accommodation recommendations  
- Places to visit suggestions  
- Food recommendations  
- Budget-based travel planning  
- Simple and interactive UI using Streamlit  
- RAG-based response generation

## 🧠 Methodology (RAG Workflow)

1. User enters destination and budget.
2. Relevant travel information is retrieved from stored destination data.
3. Retrieved data is passed to the generation module.
4. The system generates a personalized itinerary and recommendations.
5. Results are displayed on the Streamlit web interface.
